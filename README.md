## My process

- Analyzed the layout
- Wrote the HTML with clear class
- Stylized every elements to match with the mockup
- added some animations

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Goals

- my goal was to work on a very simple layout to gain confidence with flexbox, vertical positionning and to add some basics animations to improve UX

-Need to work on CSS combinators to target elements directly

-Want to experiment a new method to stylize elements with multiples simple class (like weight, color ...) instead of using 1 big class for each elements
